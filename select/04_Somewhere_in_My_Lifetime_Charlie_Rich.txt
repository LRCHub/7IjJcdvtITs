Somewhere in my lifetime
You've been here with me
Whoa, so close to me
Somewhere in my lifetime

Somewhere in my lifetime
I have kissed your lips
Lips so tenderly
They've been kissing me

Were they visions of so long ago?
You know memories come and go
Some people say, some people say they do
Are they visions of what it will be?
Somewhere in my lifetime
It's been you and me

Somewhere in my lifetime (Somewhere in my lifetime)
You've been more than just a friend (Just a friend)
Whoa, I don't have to pretend
That you were loving me

Were they visions of so long ago?
You know memories come and go
Some people say, some people say they do
Are they visions of what is to be?
Somewhere in my lifetime
Somewhere in my lifetime
Somewhere in my lifetime
It's been you and me

Somewhere in my lifetime
